# Text Sonification

Note: The python scripts will be uploaded at some point in the future.


This project is one of the assessments for the Master in Applied Cybernetics course at ANU. This is a part of a larger installation that was presented on the School of Cybernetics Demo Day.

In this installation titled <i>'Someone, I tell you, in another time, will remember us,'</i>  aims to celebrate the voices and works of three remarkable women: Hildegard of Bingen, Sophie Parnok and R.A Kartini.

These women— each from different time periods and cultural contexts —share a common thread as feminist authors who defied societal norms and contributed to the literary and intellectual landscape of their respective eras and cultures.

Using SonicPi script written in Ruby, their writings are transformed into musical notes and tones, creating a unique auditory experience that invites the audience to explore their texts in a novel way.

Sonification is the process of representing data or information using auditory cues, transforming non-auditory information into sound.

This installation highlights the potential for alternative modes of representation and interaction with information through sonification.

In this context, sonification involves mapping the written words of the authors onto musical notes, tones, or other auditory elements.

The installation invites the audience to delve into the complexities of information and interpretation, while serving as a captivating tribute that bridges the past with the present— keeping their legacies alive and inspiring new conversations of historic texts in our data-driven society.
