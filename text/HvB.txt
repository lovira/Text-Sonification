After these things
I saw a huge form, rounded and shadowy, 
and shaped like an egg; it was pointed at the top, 
wide in the middle and narrower at the bottom. 
Its outer layer consisted of an atmosphere of 
bright fire with a kind of dark membrane beneath it. 
And in that outer atmosphere there was a ball of red 
fire so large that all the huge form was lit up by it. 
Directly above the fireball was a vertical row of three 
lights which held it with their fire and energy 
and prevented it from falling. At times the fireball 
rose upwards and was met by more fire, which caused 
it to shoot out great long flames. At times, however, 
the fireball moved downwards and encountered a 
region of great cold that caused it quickly to 
retract its flames
