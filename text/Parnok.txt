Once I hear the song of the Aeolian lyre,
I catch fire, I do not walk, I danceâ€” 
mimetic my voice, nimble my hand, 
music in my veins. 
I try not my pen, I tune my strings, preoccupied 
with an inspired care, to
pour out of my heart, release into freedom 
sounds of ringing strings. 
Clearly in this life I have not forgotten
unforgettable rapture s from unforgettable 
songs that of old, my companion lovers sang
in Sappho's school.
