New conditions will come into the Javanese world,
if not through us, through others who will come after us. 
Emancipation is in the air; it has been foreordained. 
And she whose destiny it is to be the spiritual mother 
of the new age must suffer. It is the eternal law of nature: 
those who bear, must feel the pain of bearing; but the child 
has all our love, though its very existence, above that of 
all others living, has harassed us. Though it has been received 
through suffering, it is eternally precious to us
